# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This project challenged my front-end development skills and allowed me to create a user-friendly interface while implementing modern web design practices.

In this project, I developed a visually appealing and responsive recipe page using HTML, CSS, and Sass.
The page includes:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
